# H4G - Team Hephaestus

*submitted for NUS DSC's Hack-for-Good `<H4G/>` Hackathon*

**Problem Statement**: Develop and design a global tech-for-good innovation &
collaboration platform, to enhance tech-for-good information
sharing / transparency, learning, exchange and accelerate
collaboration among tech for good ecosystem players.

> In a modern world, **developers** are akin to the **carpenters, blacksmiths and workers** of older times; developing and building to improve everyday life  
>
> Hence, we've named our project after *Hephaestus*, the Greek God of craftsmen

Our solution intends to be a platform where users can freely join, chat with other developers, and explore a myriad of problem statements  
They may then submit a solution proposal through the platform, which is vetted. If accepted, they get their own section of the server dedicated to showcasing their work, and may through this section promote the work further to invite other developers to collaborate on the project

# Main Components

There are 3 main components to the project
## Main Website

The Main Website will be the landing page for this project

It will showcase
- About us information
- Trending approved projects
- Latest social problem

***
## Mattermost Server

A Discord-like, self-hostable platform for chatting and collaboration. Many integrations are available to configure it to fit any use-case. It consist of:

- One main Team to find out about current projects, problem statements, and to learn more about SIP
- One other Team to submit project ideas/proposals, side-by-side with a Playbook feature that will inform users of the requirements
- If a user's submission is accepted, they get their own Team channel to host their project, and 

### Benefits over similar platforms like Discord
- All servers are collected at one point and can be freely viewed & joined to learn more about the project
- Self-hosted and infinitely more customizeable
