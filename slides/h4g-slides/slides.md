# Hephaestus

A collaboration platform for tech4good developers



<div class="text-sm">

> *In a modern world, **developers** are akin to the **carpenters, blacksmiths and workers**   
> of older times; developing and building to improve everyday life*
> 
> *Hence, we've named our project after *Hephaestus*, the Greek God of craftsmen*  
> "  
> Christopher Tan, Clement Neo

# Chosen Problem Statement
> Develop and design a global tech-for-good innovation & collaboration platform, to enhance tech-for-good information sharing / transparency, learning, exchange and accelerate collaboration among tech for good ecosystem players

<br/>

# Pain Point
> In the current setup, there is a disconnect **between fellow Developers**, and **between the Developers and Organisations**
> - Between fellow Developers, there is no platform to discuss ideas and to share freely on what they have ideated
> - Between Developers and Organisations, Developers simply pose ideas which are either accepted or rejected by Organisaions

<br/>

# Our Solution
> Provide a platform where users can freely chat, voice call and share ideas all the while trying to solve complex world problems together

We propose a platform for people to
- Learn about social issues to work on and innovative solutions
- Propose innovative ideas or find like-minded teammates with the technical competencies
- Have their ideas follow a stringent minimum requirement or learn how to start a project
- Projects with potential are promoted and can be mentored

# Impact

### Novelty

- ðŸš… Speed of collaboration - devs can hop onto the platform to learn more about the trending social projects
- ðŸ¤¼ devs can find like minded teammates with the required technical competency or expertise
- ðŸ§« Culture of innovation - devs can bring and share radically different ideas

<br>

### Automation
- Streamline the project proposal submission process
- Allow for pledging, event submission, and act as a T4G directory
- Give approved projects a 'home page' as well as a platform to start a community and attract others to contribute

# Demo

1. Users can visit the landing page to get to Mattermost
2. Once they create an account, they are given a welcome message  
 to describe the server, and its capabilities
3. From here, users may:
  - Read the rules
  - Find out more about SIP
  - Read the available problem statements
  - Read the existing solutions being  
    developed

2. To learn more, users can click into the project to be invited into the Project's Team

<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

> Each icon is a Team, with one main Team,  
> and the resting being Teams hosting the   
> various other approved projects

# Demo - Submit Proposals
1. By heading to the Submissions Team, users can start a "Playbook" to initiate the submission process
2. A channel will be created for them, with a Playbook on the side. This contains a checklist of what to prepare
3. Once prepared, users can use the `/submit` command to fill in a form for their proposal, on Mattermost itself

<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

4. This submission is then show on the admin dashboard, to be evaluated. Admins may also chat with the user on Mattermost to get a better idea of their submission

<img src="check.png" class="rounded  border-gray-500 absolute top-50 right-70 h-68">
